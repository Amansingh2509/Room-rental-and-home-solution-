# Property Creation Debugging - Progress Tracker

## Issues to Investigate:

1. **Add Property Button Not Working**

   - Check if the button click triggers the form submission
   - Verify if the handleSubmit function is being called
   - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console

2. **Data Not Showing in Properties**

   - Verify if the property is successfully created in the database
   - Check if the PropertyContext state is updating correctly
   - Ensure the Properties component is re-rendering with new data

3. **Backend API Issues**
   - Check authentication and token validity
   - Verify required fields are being submitted
   - Check for validation errors in the backend

## Debugging Steps Completed:

### Phase 1: Enhanced Logging âœ…

- [x] Added detailed logging to backend property route
- [x] Enhanced error handling in PropertyContext
- [x] Added comprehensive logging to AddProperty component

### Phase 2: Testing and Analysis

- [ ] Test the Add Property form submission
- [ ] Check browser console for frontend errors
- [ ] Monitor backend server logs for API requests
- [ ] Verify database entries after submission

### Phase 3: Fix Implementation

- [ ] Identify and fix the root cause based on logs
- [ ] Implement necessary corrections
- [ ] Test the complete flow

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the Add Property Form**

   - Fill out the form and click "Add Property"
   - Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
   - Look for network requests to `/api/properties`

2. **Check Backend Logs**

   - Look for incoming requests in the backend console
   - Check for authentication errors
   - Look for validation or database errors

3. **Verify Database**
   - Check if properties are being saved to the database
   - Verify all required fields are populated

## Expected Log Output:

### Frontend Console Should Show:

- Form data being prepared
- API request being sent
- Response from server (success or error)

### Backend Console Should Show:

- Incoming POST request to `/api/properties`
- User authentication details
- Form data received
- Property creation process
- Any validation errors

## Common Issues to Look For:

- Missing required fields
- Authentication token issues
- File upload problems
- Database validation errors
- State management issues in React
