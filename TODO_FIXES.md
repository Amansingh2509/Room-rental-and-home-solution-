# Property Creation Fix - Progress Tracking

## Issue: Property data not being saved to database and not showing in properties list

### Root Cause Identified:

1. Backend route was not extracting all form fields from FormData
2. Missing handling for security deposit fields and QR payment screenshot
3. File upload configuration needed to handle multiple file types

### Fixes Applied:

âœ… **Phase 1: Backend Route Update**

- [x] Updated `backend/routes/property.js` to use `upload.fields()` instead of `upload.array()`
- [x] Added handling for QR payment screenshot file upload
- [x] Added extraction of security deposit fields: `securityDepositOptions`, `securityDepositAmount`, `securityDepositPaid`
- [x] Enhanced error handling and logging

âœ… **Phase 2: Database Schema Update**

- [x] Updated `backend/modules/property.js` schema to include new fields:
  - `securityDepositPaid: Boolean`
  - `securityDepositOptions: Map`
  - `qrPaymentScreenshot: String`

### Next Steps:

ðŸ”² **Phase 3: Testing**

- [ ] Test property creation with all fields
- [ ] Verify data is properly saved to MongoDB
- [ ] Check if properties are displayed correctly in the frontend
- [ ] Test QR payment screenshot upload functionality

ðŸ”² **Phase 4: Validation**

- [ ] Ensure all form fields are properly processed
- [ ] Verify security deposit calculation works correctly
- [ ] Test image upload functionality

### Testing Commands:

1. Start backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to: http://localhost:5175/add-property
4. Fill out the property form completely
5. Upload images and QR payment screenshot
6. Submit and verify data is saved

### Expected Behavior:

- Property data should be saved to MongoDB
- Properties should appear in the properties list
- All form fields should be properly stored and displayed
- Images and QR screenshot should be uploaded and accessible
