# TODO: Connect AddPropertyEnhancedComplete.jsx with Backend

## Steps to Complete:

1. [ ] Review and verify the `handleSubmit` function in `AddPropertyEnhancedComplete.jsx`
2. [ ] Ensure all required form fields are included in the FormData
3. [ ] Test the property creation flow from frontend to backend
4. [ ] Verify that properties are displayed in the properties list after creation

## Current Status:

- Frontend component is ready with form handling
- PropertyContext has the `addProperty` function implemented
- Backend routes are set up for property creation
- Database schema is defined for properties

## Notes:

- The system uses token-based authentication
- File uploads are handled using Multer
- Properties should be visible in `/properties` page after creation
